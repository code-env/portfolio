## Genesis

Twenty-one (21) years ago, I was born. Normally, every normal child, when given birth, has to cry. Guess what? I didn’t, so I had to receive a knock on my head on the first day of birth 🤣. This left a hole on my head (nevertheless, I’m still looking for that doctor, and I want him dead or alive 🤣). This hole resulted in several insults from my classmates when I was in primary school, who kept calling my head **bicycle seat**.

## The Dee Day

As every other day on localhost, I wake up at **8:30 AM** because I go to bed at **3:30 AM**. But today was different. I decided to wake up rather early and even went to bed earlier the day before. Funny enough, my cousin and I were delivered on the same day (he's 5, by the way). So I made sure I was the first to wish him Happy Birthday, even before his mother (awhhnn, brotherly love, right? 🤣 IKR).

## Morning Vibes

By mid-morning, my phone had turned into a buzzing beehive. Messages, calls, and memes flooded in from friends and family. My mom brought out her _legendary birthday breakfast spread_: pancakes, eggs, bacon, fresh fruit—you name it. I couldn’t help but think, “If this is what getting older feels like, then sign me up for another 21 years of this.”

## Mini Celebration

In the afternoon, I spent some time with Junior—my cousin who shares my birthday. We had a small celebration, cutting a cake together. Junior’s excitement about his fifth birthday was so contagious. He ran around yelling, "I'm a big boy now!" while I just stood there, trying to soak in the moment of being the _actual big guy_.

## Evening Fun

As the sun set, the real fun began. My closest friends came over for a small gathering. We sat around, reminiscing about old times, playing games, and dreaming about the future. Someone started teasing me about the "bicycle seat" head story, and we all had a good laugh.

## The Cake

The highlight of the evening was the cake—a massive one that could have fed a small army. Everyone sang "Happy Birthday," and I blew out the candles with a wish tucked deep in my heart. (Don’t ask; it’s between me and the universe. 😉)

## Reflection

By midnight, as the noise faded and I lay in bed, I found myself smiling. The day had been filled with love, laughter, and all the little moments that make life worth it. A simple yet perfect day on localhost.
