## Genesis

Twenty-one (21) years ago, I was born. Normally, every normal child, when given birth, has to cry. Guess what? I didn’t, so I had to receive a knock on my head on the first day of birth 🤣. This left a hole on my head (nevertheless, I’m still looking for that doctor, and I want him dead or alive 🤣). This hole resulted in several insults from my classmates when I was in primary school, who kept calling my head **bicycle seat**.

## The Dee Day

As every other day on localhost, I wake up at **8:30 AM** because I go to bed at **3:30 AM**. But today was different. I decided to wake up rather early and even went to bed earlier the day before. Funny enough, my cousin and I were delivered on the same day (he's 5, by the way). So I made sure I was the first to wish him Happy Birthday, even before his mother (awhhnn, brotherly love, right? 🤣 IKR).

## Morning Vibes

By mid-morning, my laptop had turned into a buzzing beehive (cause i don't have a phone). Messages, calls, and memes flooded in from friends and family. My mom brought out her _legendary birthday breakfast quote_: You know I don't have money. I couldn’t help but think, “If this is what getting older feels like, then sign me up for another 21 years of this.”

## Mini Celebration

In the afternoon, I spent some time with Junior—my cousin who shares my birthday. We had a small celebration, cutting a cake together. Junior’s excitement about his fifth birthday was so contagious. He ran around yelling, "I'm a big boy now!" while I just stood there, trying to soak in the moment of being the _actual big guy_.

## Evening Fun

As the sun set, the real fun began. My closest friends came over for a small gathering. We sat around, reminiscing about old times, them giving talks about me and things I've done. Someone started teasing me about the "bicycle seat" head story, and we all had a good laugh. One said this _Zenith your life is like the programs you write out every day, full of bugs and errors🤣. The more you explore life the easier it'll be for your to resolve the conflicts and errors you're currently facing_. I was like, "I'm not a bug, I'm a feature." 🤣

## The Cake

The highlight of the evening was the cake—a massive one that could have fed a small arsenal of developers and friends. Everyone sang "Happy Birthday," and I blew out the candles (in my head cause it had no candle) with a wish tucked deep in my heart. (Don’t ask; it’s between me and the universe. 😉)

## Reflection

By midnight, as the noise faded and I lay in bed, I found myself smiling and happy as never before on my birthday. The day had been filled with love, laughter, and all the little moments that make life worth it. A simple yet perfect day on localhost.
