I've had a year of experiences as a developer from Cameroon, filled with both good moments and challenging ones. Some years for me have always started well and smooth, but by the end, they finish like a nightmare. However, 2024 didnâ€™t follow that pattern, and a lot happened this year that I can only try to put into words here. Honestly, I can't even remember everything that transpired this year. One thing we often overlook as developers is how fast time flies while weâ€™re seated in front of our computers, staring at the screen and trying to fix that error we encountered while pushing to production on a Friday.

Looking back at 2024, itâ€™s been a year of growth, both personally and professionally. I made significant progress in my career, explored exciting projects, and built (still building btw) meaningful relationships that are shaping my journey. From finally shipping some long-awaited personal projects to working with a YC-backed company, Bref the journey is really something mind-blowing.

## How the year started

In January of the year (2024), I was a high school student with a goal of just making it out to completely focus on building my tech skills because, even though my mom was not telling me it straight to my face, I felt that was my way out if I wanted to continue on this path of mine.

After graduating from high school, I saw how happy my mom was, and from there, boom, I felt like, for once, I had the access over my own future to control it and do whatever the F\*ck I wanted to do.

## Mid-year vibes

After finishing high school, that's when I had to make a major decision of my life (continuing with school or sitting down and working on me), and any decision I would've made, my mom would've been down for it. So I decided to continue fine-tuning my skills and making myself more valuable to the community of developers in my region. During this same period, given that the results were out for high school grads, I didnâ€™t know I was this loved by almost everyone in the family. I started receiving calls from one family member to another, and guess what? After telling me congrats, the next question that followed was, "Where are you going to continue your education?" As strong as it was for me to just accept everything or suggestions that were made by them, one of my uncles even told me to go join the armed forces ðŸ¤£. However, they kept bugging me until I didnâ€™t change my mind.

## The _ember_ months

These are the last four months of the year that I decided to go all in on myself and in my dev journey. For the past four years of building sites, I've always focused on just the building and performance, not the user experience. So I decided to take a bump in my _Frontend_ career. I decided to learn by building while reading [Steal Like an Artist](https://bossadizenith.me) by _Austin Kleon_. After like a week of overthinking on what to build, it came to me: what do I struggle with the most? Answer: creating animations on sites. Which means others likely face this same problem. So I created [Ground](https://ground.bossadizenith.me), a platform that will help other developers like me to just **Copy, Paste, Animate**, just like our favorite [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com). While still learning by reading documentation and watching YouTube videos for more complicated topics that the docs couldn't make clear for me. After a few weeks, the project blew up, and others started sharing it. At the moment I'm writing this, it has 280+ stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/code-env/framer-ground).

## The offer

After Ground started blowing up, most of the animations there were done in Figma by [Kumail Nanji](https://x.com/kumailnanji). By this time, he was working with a YC S24-backed company called [Cardlift](https://withcardlift.com), and the CEO of the company reached out to me on Discord and sent me this text: _"Hey Bossadi, Would you be interested in joining our team at withcardlift.com. You would be working with Kumail and other beast developers. Ycombinator backed company. Would love to have you join us"_ At first, I thought it was a joke, but it turned out not to be one. Even though I didn't continue working with them for long, I learned something: **Don't be desperate, know your worth.** The money I earned working with them permitted me to purchase a new laptop.

## What awaits me

There's this famous quote that says: **"The best way to predict the future is to create it."** That's what I'm doing: creating my own future one step at a time while still working on myself, both skills-wise and mentally as well.

## Conclusion

One of the things I see in my brothers and sisters here in Africa and even those around the world (especially those in the tech world) is that they underestimate themselves too much. For me, it hurts to see that even those outside of Africa sometimes can't see the opportunities they have to pave their way, especially with the benefits they have like Stripe cashout in their countries, which we here in Africa donâ€™t yet have. However, there's no excuse, and since the beginning of this year, I can't say how grateful I've been for continuing in such a field of vast interest and rapid growth. Nevertheless, I recently asked my PA how she's seeing the future, and she said this: **"I can't see the future because it's damn bright."** And hell yeah, it's damn bright.
