I've had a year of experiences as a developer from Cameroon, filled with both good moments and challenging ones. Some years for me have always started well and smooth, but by the end, they finish like a nightmare. However, 2024 didnâ€™t follow that pattern, and a lot happened this year that I can only try to put into words here. Honestly, I can't even remember everything that transpired this year. One thing we often overlook as developers is how fast time flies while weâ€™re seated in front of our computers, staring at the screen and trying to fix that error we encountered while pushing to production on a Friday.

Looking back at 2024, itâ€™s been a year of growth, both personally and professionally. I made significant progress in my career, explored exciting projects, and built (still building btw) meaningful relationships that are shaping my journey. From finally shipping some long-awaited personal projects to working with a YC backed company, Bref the journey is really something mindblowing.

## How the year started

In January of the year (2024), I was a high school student with a goal of just making it out to completely focus on building my tech skills because my even though my muy was not telling me it straight to my face, i felt that was my way out if i want to continue in this path of mine.
After finishing graduating from high school, i saw how happy my mum was and from there, boom i felt like for once i had the access over my own future to control it and do what ever the F\*ck i wanted to do.

## Mid year vibes

After finishing high school, that's when i had to make a major decision of my life (continuing with school or seat down and work on me), and any decision i would've made, my mum would've been down for it so i decided to continue with finetuning my skills and making myself more valuable to the community of developers in my region. And during this same period of the year given that the results where out for the high school grad's, I didnâ€™t know i was this loved by almost everyone in the family. so i started receiving calls from one family member to another and guess what after telling me congrats, the next question that followed was, where are you going to continue your education and as strong as it was for me to just be aceepting everything or suggestions that was made by them. And one of my uncles even told me to go join the arm force ðŸ¤£. However they kept bugging me until i didnâ€™t change my mind.

## The _ember_ months

These are the four last months of the year that i decided to go all in on myself and in my dev journey. For the past four years of building sites, i've always focused on just the building and performance not the user experiences so i decided to take a bump in my _Frontend_ carrier. So i decided to learn by building while reading [Steal like an artist](https://bossadizenith.me) by _Zenith noble_. after like a week of overthinking on what to build, it came to me that what do i struggle from the most? answer: Creating animations on sites. which means that others as well face this same problem. so I created [Ground](https://ground.bossadizenith.me) a platform that will help other developers like to just **Copy, Paste, Animate** just like our favorite [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com). while still learning by reading documentations and watching youtube videos for more complicated topics that the docs couldn't make clear for me. after after a few weeks, the project blewup and others started sharing it and at moment i'm writing this, it has 280+ stars on [Github](https://github.com/code-env/framer-ground).

## The offer

After ground started blowing up, most of the animations there was done in figma by [Kumail Nanji](https://x.com/kumailnanji) and by this time, he is working with a yc S24 backed company called [Cardlift](https://withcardlift.com) and the CEO of the company reached out to me on on Dicord and sent me this text _Hey Bossadi ....._ and at first i thought it was a joke however it turned out not to be one. And even though I didn't continue working with them for long, I learnt something: **Don't be desperate, know your worth**. and the money i worked with them, permited me to purchase a new laptop.

## What awaits me

There's this famous quote that says: **`the best way to predict the future is to create it`** and that's what I'm doing, I'm creating my own future one step at a time while still working on me both skills wise and mental wise as well.

## Conclusion.

One of the things i see in my brothers and sisters here in Africa and even those around the world(especially those in the tech world), is that they underestimate themselves toomuch and for me it hurts to see that even those out of Africa sometimes can't see the opportunites the have to pave their ways especially with the benefits they have like Stripe cashout in their countries and us here in Africa don't yet have. However there's no excuse and since the beginning of this year, i can't say how grateful i've been of continuing in such of field of vast interest and rapid growth. Nevertheless I recently asked my PA how she's seeing the future and said this **`i can't see the future, cause it's damn bright`** and hell yeah it's damn bright.
