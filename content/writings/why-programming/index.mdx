## Why Programming, Not Something Else

Bref I'm Zenith 20 years old (by the time I'm writing this) and I'm building things that live on the internet while chilling from localhost. Born and raised in Cameroon, Iâ€™ve come to appreciate the unique power of codeâ€”a power that transcends borders, connects people, and creates solutions to problems I once thought were unsolvable. Choosing programming over any other path wasnâ€™t just a career decision; it was a calling.

## My First Encounter with Code

When they talk of my country Cameroon out of the country(abroad), we always refer to sports and we listen to names like **Francis Nganou**, **Sameul Eto'o** and the other athletes that distinguish themselves this is simply because in Cameroon, technology wasnâ€™t isn't at our fingertips. However, my curiosity was sparked when I first encountered this group of friends in secondary school(that was in 2018). Watching them manipulate those machines was mesmerizing(I think shit was frustrating even back then). Their fingers danced across the keyboard, typing at their thought speed lol(in-fact i think these guys were typing fore they sat and thought on what they had to type), crafting programs in languages like _C_ and others I couldnâ€™t even name. Then came the moment of magic. When they ran their programs and the output appeared on the screen. My jaw dropped. My brain raced. "If these lines of code can create something so incredible," I thought, "I want to learn how to write my own."

That was my first taste of programming, and I was instantly hooked.

I remember spending countless hours in internet cafes, teaching myself the basics of coding through free online resources. It wasnâ€™t easyâ€”slow internet, limited access to resources, and the lack of a mentor made the journey challenging. But every small success, every "Hello, World!" moment, fueled my determination.

## The Endless Possibilities of Code

Programming offers something extraordinary: a blank canvas where your ideas can take shape and come to life. Whether it's building software that impacts businesses, creating tools to simplify lives, or solving community issues, the possibilities are truly limitless. This freedom and creativity are what drew me in.

Unlike many other fields, programming allows you to see the direct results of your work almost immediately. The joy of debugging a challenging error or watching a project come to life is unmatched. Itâ€™s like solving a complex puzzle, but the reward isnâ€™t just personal satisfactionâ€”itâ€™s knowing that your work can make a real difference in the world.

## Cameroonâ€™s Potential and My Role in It

Coming from Cameroon, Iâ€™ve witnessed firsthand the challenges our communities face, from education gaps to limited access to technology. But Iâ€™ve also seen the incredible potential in the youths around me. Through programming, I believe I can contribute to unlocking this potential. Technology, after all, is a bridgeâ€”one that connects us to opportunities we never thought possible.

For instance, during my school years, I started a **Science and Technology Club** to solve real problems using tech. That experience reinforced my belief that programming isnâ€™t just about building apps; itâ€™s about building solutions and hope. One of our first projects was creating a prototype for an automated irrigation system for local farmersâ€”a simple idea that could have a significant impact if fully realized.

## Why Not Something Else?

At some point, Iâ€™ve asked myself why I didnâ€™t choose another pathâ€”medicine (actually my parents wanted me to become a doctor can you imagine that? I would've forgotten a **Scalpel** in someone's stomarch ðŸ˜‚), law, or even business. The answer is simple: while those fields are vital, programming resonates with who I am. It challenges my mind, fuels my creativity, and allows me to contribute meaningfully to society.

Thereâ€™s also the beauty of accessibility. With just a laptop and an internet connection, you can start learning programming from anywhere in the world. This democratization of knowledge is something that deeply appeals to me, as it aligns with my desire to make technology accessible to everyone in my community.

## Overcoming Challenges

The journey hasnâ€™t been without its obstacles. From moments of self-doubt to struggling with complex algorithms, there were times I questioned whether I was cut out for this. But each challenge taught me resilience. I learned that failure is not the endâ€”itâ€™s a stepping stone to growth. In fact, some of my best lessons came from projects that didnâ€™t work out as planned.

One pivotal moment was when I worked on a web app for a local event. It was my first major project, and I underestimated the complexity involved. The app crashed during the event, and I felt defeated. But instead of giving up, I took it as an opportunity to learn. That experience made me a better developer, more meticulous in my planning and execution.

## Advice for Aspiring Programmers

To anyone considering programming, especially those from underrepresented communities like Cameroon: donâ€™t let doubt hold you back. Dive in, stay curious, and embrace the challenges. Programming is hard, but itâ€™s also incredibly rewarding.

Start small. Build projects that interest you, no matter how simple they seem. Engage with online communities, find mentors, and never stop learning. Remember, programming isnâ€™t just about writing code; itâ€™s about solving problems and telling stories through technology.

And remember, youâ€™re not just writing code; youâ€™re shaping the future. The skills you develop today could solve tomorrowâ€™s biggest problems.

## Final Thoughts

Programming chose me as much as I chose it. Itâ€™s more than a skill; itâ€™s a way to empower myself and others. At just 20 years old, I feel like Iâ€™m only scratching the surface of whatâ€™s possible. The journey has just begun, and Iâ€™m excited to see where this path will take me.
